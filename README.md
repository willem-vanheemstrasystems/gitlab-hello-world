# GitLab - Hello World

A "Hello World" example using GitLab

This follows from [Hackerrank - Hello World](https://github.com/willem-vanheemstrasystems/hackerrank-hello-world) where the Test Driven Development approach of software development has been practiced on a simple piece of code; Hello World.

In this section we aim to apply the same principle; a simple example of establishing a code environment using GitLab for continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) of the 'Hello World' example.
